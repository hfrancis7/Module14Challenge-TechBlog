It seems he's underestimated your strength. Or more accurately... THEIR strength.
I will give you this option.
I will allow you to retreat and recover.
Wintersplinter will rise. It will come for the Winery.
You will have one day to prepare for the onslaught.

If you win, then you may have the gem that resides within.
If you lose, then the winery will be destroyed. The owners will perish. And you will accompany me back to Castle Ravenloft for dinner.
